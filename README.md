# Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Standards Attainment Deficit
This R Shiny APP is designed for visualizing the water quality standards attainment deficit for the tidal segments of Chesapeake Bay.

Notes:
1. Attainment deficit: 0% = full attainment; -100% = full non-attainment.
2. Designated use: OW = open water dissolved oxygen (DO); DW = deep water DO; DC = deep channel DO; MSN = migratory spawning and nursery DO; CHLspr = chlorophyll-a (spring); CHLsum = chlorophyll-a (summer).
3. Assessment period: Year represents the first year of a 3-year assessment period, e.g., year 1985 represents the 1985-1987 period; year 2018 represents the 2018-2020 period.
